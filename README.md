# Perfect Numbers

This is a small web app built with Spring Boot and React.js.  
  
You can use it in 2 ways:
* query a single number and check if it's a [Perfect Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number)
* Discover all perfect numbers given a range
  * It uses an algorithm based on [Mersenne Primes](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primo_de_Mersenne) for optimizing really large ranges.

## Usage

Clone this repo, `cd` to the directory and run `./build.sh` (make sure to `chmod +x ./build.sh` it first, if needed).  
Then, run `./run.sh` (chmod it too). The app should be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
